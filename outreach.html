<h1>Outreach</h1>

<p>
	USU's SWE section participates in a variety of outreach activities, including
	Science Unwrapped, and our very own Engineering Extravaganza. The purpose of 
	these activities is to provide opportunities for youth, especially girls, to 
	explore STEM and provide support for them to pursue a technical education.
